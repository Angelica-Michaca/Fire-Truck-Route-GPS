# Fire-Truck-Route-GPS
Our fire truck GPS implements both the Uniform Cost Search (UCS) and Greedy Search to explore the efficiency of a uninformed (deterministic) search method and a informed (Heuristic-based/stochastic). Our project aims to highlight the pros and cons of each search method, while also identifying the optimal route.
